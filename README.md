Hi. My name is Vinicius, and I started coding with 18 years old using python. My main goal at that time was to get approved for a selective proccess, which I was not accepted after all..
A couple weeks after the result, I was coding again, and found it really interesting and powerfull. I started doing Kaggle exercises and even had a Google course on Coursera, which helped me
to keep improving my skills. I became interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, and built my first project in this area in 2022.
